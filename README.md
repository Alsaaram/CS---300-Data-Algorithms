# CS-300-Data-Algorithms

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course, we had to create the code to sort and return courses depending on their prerequisites. The user would navigate through a menu and decide which option they wanted. The available options included viewing the entire list of courses or focusing on their desired course along with its prerequisites. We accomplished this task by utilizing vectors, linked lists, and a binary search tree.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I began by watching instructional videos on each method and wrote pseudocode to establish a solid foundation. Subsequently, I implemented and tested my code using the Visual Studio IDE. Understanding data structures is crucial because they provide insights into the total memory usage and runtime of an application. This understanding is based on the type of data being processed and the specific data structure chosen for program implementation.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I faced a few roadblocks during the process, mainly in understanding the intricacies of the data structure and ensuring it functioned correctly. To navigate these challenges, I followed a systematic approach. I carefully studied the outline, breaking down the task into manageable sections. I wrote the code step by step and rigorously tested each section before moving on. If errors persisted, I patiently troubleshooted until the section was error-free, confirmed through rigorous testing in the IDE, before proceeding to the next part of the implementation.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has significantly expanded my understanding of problem-solving, emphasizing the importance of breaking down problems into manageable steps and researching solutions when faced with challenges. Moreover, it highlighted the significance of documenting the code comprehensively. Leaving detailed comments not only aids my own understanding but also facilitates collaboration with colleagues. These comments serve as invaluable references, ensuring that the code remains accessible and understandable for future edits or modifications.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Writing clear and detailed comments within the code has significantly enhanced my programming skills. This practice is a vital tool for ensuring that code remains maintainable, readable, and adaptable over time. Comments serve as a roadmap for developers, guiding them to specific sections where changes or fixes are needed. By employing this approach, we create code that is not rigid but rather flexible, designed to be easily adapted for future purposes. This adaptability is key in the ever-changing landscape of software development.
